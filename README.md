## About

Desdemona Toolkit is free and open-source desktop application for externally viewing and managing Fortnite accounts with high focus on customizability and safety.

<b>Safe</b> - Designed to guarantee that credentials or any data will never be sent to me or any other third party.  
<b>Open-source</b> - All code is public and licenced under GPL-3.0!  
<b>Customization</b> - Make it yours with flexible settings and options.  

### ⚠️Desdemona Toolkit is currently in early active development. You should expect bugs, breaking changes and lack of features early-on.⚠️

## Why?

One day, I wanted to show off my cosmetics collection to a friend, but I only found solutions that required sending my credentials to third parties. So, I decided to write my own script... then added a few extra features... then scrapped it all and created a stand-alone desktop application as my pet project, so others don't have to worry about where their credentials and data might end up.

## Features

⭐ Browse your inventory including unlocked styles with advanced filtering
⭐ Export your inventory to Fortnite.GG or as a customizable image  
⭐ Create custom filter based on your needs with simple, but powerful DTKF filtering language
⭐ Fetch the newest item data at any time 

## Usage

See [Wiki](https://github.com/YanehCheck/DesdemonaToolkit/wiki) for FAQ, usage and on how to create your own filter.

## Installation and set-up

    - Framework-dependent version requires .NET8 runtime pre-installed
